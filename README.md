# Sock Puppet Theater

Sock Puppet Theater is a web-based project where users can create sock puppet characters and use them to write and perform their own plays. The site is designed to be simple, creative, and fun, allowing anyone to tell stories without needing special tools or experience.

This project is hosted on Vercel and runs entirely in the browser.

## Overview

The goal of Sock Puppet Theater is to give users a digital space to experiment with storytelling. Users can design puppets, assign dialogue, and move through scenes like a small stage play. The focus is on creativity and writing, not advanced graphics or realism.

The idea for this project came from a randomly generated prompt and was built as a way to turn that idea into a complete, interactive website.
